# Home / Embedded Requirements Guideline

This document defines how embedded software requirements and C API documentation are written in this project.

It establishes:

- What aspects embedded requirements should cover  
- How functional and non-functional requirements are defined  
- How hardware interaction is specified  
- How timing, memory, and CPU constraints are documented  
- How public C APIs are structured and described  
- How requirements are verified  
- Which wording conventions are used  

The goal is:

- Clear and unambiguous requirements  
- Measurable and testable definitions  
- Consistent API documentation  
- Reduced ambiguity during implementation  
- Improved review and verification quality  

This document serves as a practical guideline.  
It promotes structured and precise documentation while remaining adaptable to project-specific needs.

Contributors are expected to follow the principles described in this guide to ensure consistent and high-quality requirements.
