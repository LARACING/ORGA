# Keep it Professional but readable

This document serves as a guideline rather than a strict specification.
Its purpose is to promote clarity, consistency, and quality in embedded software requirements.
It is not intended to restrict reasonable engineering judgment.
Deviations are acceptable if they improve clarity or better suit the specific project context.
For example, if a tabular overview of all API functions including inputs and outputs improves readability, it should be used.
The document may be refined or adapted after internal review or peer feedback.
