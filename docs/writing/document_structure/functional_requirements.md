### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements should describe the system’s behavior during normal operation and in defined edge or fault conditions.
Less precise:
> The module must sample the ADC every 1 ms.
More precise:
> The module must sample the ADC with a nominal period of 1 ms and a tolerance of ±5
The second version defines a measurable timing constraint and can be verified during testing.
