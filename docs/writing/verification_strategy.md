# Verification Strategy

Each requirement should be verifiable via:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Hardware tests/measurements
- Static analysis
- Code inspection
Example:

> Timing requirements must be verified using oscilloscope measurements or processor cycle counter analysis on the target.
