# Basics

## What is git?

Git is a distributed version control system.
Core concepts:

- Repository (repo) -> `Project with history`
- Commit            -> `snapshot of changes`
- Branch            -> `movable poitner to commits`
- HEAD              -> `current position`
- Remote            -> `hosted repo (e.g. on GitHub)`
- Staging Area      -> `what will go in the next commit`
